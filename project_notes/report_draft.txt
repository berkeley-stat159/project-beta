1. Data Description:
Prolonged quasi-natural auditory stimulation (Forrest Gump audio movie)

Details:
2 hour in total for 1 subject 
8 runs 
15 mins each run
Format: 4D volumetric images (160x160x36)in NIfTI format
TR: 2s
Sequence: T2*-weighted gradient-echo EPI sequence (1.4 mm isotropic voxel size). 
**: These images have partial brain coverage — centered on the auditory cortices
 in both brain hemispheres and include frontal and posterior portions of the 
 brain. There is no coverage for the upper portion of the brain (e.g. large 
 parts of motor and somato-sensory cortices).”
